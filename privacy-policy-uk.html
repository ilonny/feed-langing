    <p>This policy was last updated on 28.04.2020. </p>
    <p>Feed Application Limited (“Feed”, “we”, “us”, “our”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy
      explains the way in which we collect, manage, use and protect any personal data we obtain through your engagement
      with us, as well as your legal rights in respect of your data. By “personal data” we mean any information, alone
      or jointly with other similar information, that could be used to identify you.</p>
    <p>This Policy covers any personal data we collect in connection with your use of the FEED app (the “App”) and
      www.feedapp.me (the “Website”), where you can learn more about the App and any other services we offer you (the
      “Feed Services”).</p>
    <p>Use of our App and Website are subject to your agreement to the terms of this Privacy Policy. Our Terms of Use,
      Terms and Conditions and any other agreement we might have with you (as may be amended from time to time). </p>
    <h2>About us</h2>
    <p>For the purposes of applicable data protection laws, Feed Application Limited, a company incorporated in England
      and Wales with its registered address at 4th Floor Imperial House, 8 Kean Street, London, WC2B 4AS (company no.
      12753658), is the controller of your data. This means that we are the primary entity who decides the purposes and
      means for dealing with your personal data.</p>
    <p>We have appointed a designated data protection officer. If you have any questions about this privacy policy,
      please contact them using the details set out below. </p>
    <h2>What personal data do we collect about you?</h2>
    <p>When you access the App or Website, we may collect a variety of personal data about you, including:</p>
    <p>Data that you provide to us directly</p>
    <p>Feed primarily collects personal data provided by you directly when you sign up to or use the Appor Website,

      <li>Your preferred language for use of the App </li>
      <li>Any personal information contained within any user content you upload to the App (e.g. username, account
        password, photos, videos, audio recordings, any personal information you disclose about yourself in your user
        profile or interactions with other users)</li>
      <li>Any personal information contained within any content on your device to which you have permitted App access
        (e.g. any data imported from your device with your permission such as images uploaded from your device photo
        gallery or address book for syncing contacts on the App) </li>
      <li>Any information relating to your interactions with other users and accounts of the App, e.g. which groups you
        are part of, how you respond to other users’ content on the App, and which users you have added to your

        request our services (e.g. contact details, username, customer reference number). </li>

    <p>We will let you know at the point of collecting your information whether this is optional, or whether it is
      necessary for you to provide this information to meet certain statutory or contractual requirements (e.g. to set
      up your user account). If the latter and you do not wish to provide us with this information, this may limit your
      ability to use the App or Website and the services we are able to provide to you. </p>

      account (e.g. video messages, profile information and photo) will be entirely optional and only done when you
      choose to do so. </p>

    <p>Where we rely on consent to process your personal data, you have the right to withdraw your consent to these
      activities at any time, which will mean (unless another lawful basis applies to your data) that we will cease to
      process the affected data after consent is withdrawn. However, please note this may result in us being unable to
      provide you with certain features of the Feed Services.</p>
    <p>If you wish to withdraw your consent to any of the above activities, you can do so by adjusting your preferences

    <h2>Who do we share your data with?</h2>
    <p>We may disclose the personal data that we collect with the following third parties:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Our third party providers of our business and operational services. These parties are authorized to process
        your personal data on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions, and only as necessary to provide the Feed
        Services. These include our providers of:</li>
      <li>Product design and development services (e.g. our app developers)</li>

        hosted data center and backup providers)</li>

      <li>Any potential or actual third party buyer of our business and/or assets in the event that we sell, trade or

      <li>Third parties we may be required to disclose such personal data to in order to comply with our legal
        obligations, to enforce our legal rights or to protect our members, g. any relevant authority or enforcement
        body and fraud protection and credit risk reduction agencies or emergency services.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We will never share or sell your personal data with third parties for advertising/ marketing purposes. </p>
    <h2>Will my personal data be sent abroad?</h2>
    <p>All personal data processed in connection with the App and the Website is stored securely on our on-premises
      servers in the United States. We rent those servers from Google Cloud as our hosting partner. Data is backed up to
      a regional datacenter within the EU as well via ​Google Cloud Platform​ and ​Amazon Web Services​. </p>
    <p>If you are based in the UK or EU this means we need to transfer your personal data in the outside the European
      Economic Area, and additional regulations may apply under applicable data protection laws to ensure a similar
      degree of protection is afforded to your personal data. Such additional regulations may also apply to any future
      transfers of personal data outside the EEA. </p>
    <p>At the date of this policy the position in respect of transfers of data between the UK and EU are constantly
      changing, but we will ensure that such transfers are made subject to appropriate safeguards as may be required by
      any applicable data protection laws from time to time. These will include ensuring that the data is only located
      in a country deemed to hold adequacy status or through the use of approved standard contractual clauses.</p>
    <p>For more details on the safeguards in place for transfers of your personal data abroad, including how to obtain
      copies of these where relevant, please contact us using the details below. </p>
    <h2>How long will you hold my data?</h2>
    <p>We keep your data for as long as it’s necessary to meet the relevant purposes for which we’ve collected your
      data, including for the purpose of satisfying any legal, accounting or reporting requirements.</p>
    <p>Generally speaking we will retain your personal data as long as you keep your account open or as needed to
      provide you the Feed Services, including data you or others provided to us from your use of the Feed Services.
      Once your account is cancelled and deactivated, or if you have made a formal request for the deletion of your
      personal data in accordance with the section “Your rights over your personal data” below, all your personal will
      be permanently removed or anonymized. </p>
    <p>However, please note that permanent deletion may not always be possible based on the nature of your data. For
      example, content you have shared with other users or if you participate in a public online conference “room”, will
      mean that your audio/video messages will continue to exist as part of a larger feed with content from other users
      on the other participants’ profiles and can’t be deleted unless all other relevant users also delete their
      accounts.</p>
    <p>In some instances we may also need to hold your personal data beyond the duration of your account, for example if
      you are still signed up to receive marketing newsletters from us (until you withdraw your consent) or to comply
      with any legal record-keeping obligations. In particular, we will retain product usage and customer support logs
      for up to 4 weeks after your account cancellation/data deletion request, and will request that our service
      providers remove that data from their servers as well as removing it ourselves after that. Where possible, we will
      take extra steps to protect your personal data if this needs to be retained longer than the retention periods
      specified here, such as anonymization. </p>
    <p>To determine the appropriate length of time for holding your data, we consider the amount, nature, and
      sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm, from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal
      data, the purpose for which we process your data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means,
      along with the applicable legal requirements. </p>
    <h2>How do you keep my personal data safe?</h2>
    <p>We have taken appropriate security measures to protect your personal data from destruction, loss, unauthorized
      provision or other unauthorized operation. In particular, to the extent appropriate and possible we rely on the
      use of cryptographic techniques, logging, adoption of pseudonymization of data, as well as ensuring the permanent
      confidentiality, integrity and resilience of processing systems and regular testing, assessment and evaluation of
      the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures to ensure safety of your data.</p>
    <h2>Your rights over your personal data</h2>
    <p>If you are based in the UK or EU, you may, in circumstances, have the following rights in relation to the
      Personal Data we hold about you.</p>
    <p>You can exercise all the rights applicable to you by contacting us via email at support@feedapp.me.</p>
    <p>You can request to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>access a copy of the information held about you. You can request a copy of all personal data that we hold
        about you. We do not remove your data when you request a download.</li>
      <li>rectify any incorrect or incomplete data we hold about you. It is in both our interests that any personal
        information we hold about you is accurate, complete and current. If the data we hold about you is inaccurate in
        any way, please contact us to have your personal information corrected. You can also update any incorrect
        contact information yourself by updating your user profile information on the App. </li>
      <li>delete, restrict or remove the data we hold about you. You can request to temporarily suspend your account or
        delete it and all personal data we hold about you, to the extent possible, where you believe our processing of
        your personal data is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was obtained or you have withdrawn your
        consent for such processing. Please see the section “How long will you hold my data?” above for further details
        about how we deal with any data removal requests. </li>
      <li>transfer the data we hold about you to another party, subject to any technical system constraints between the
        parties</li>
      <li>object to any further processing of your data, if we are processing your personal data on the basis of our
        legitimate interests (see “How do we use your personal data and for what grounds” above), or for direct
        marketing purposes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We will endeavor to respond to your requests within one month and free of charge. Please note that in respect of
      all these rights, we reserve the right to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>refuse your request based on the exemptions set out in the applicable data protection legislation</li>
      <li>request for proof of your ID to process the request or request further information</li>
      <li>charge you a reasonable administrative fee for any repetitive, manifestly unfounded or excessive requests</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If we refuse your request to exercise these rights, we will give reasons for our refusal and allow you to
      challenge our decision. If we have shared your data with others, we will tell them about your request to rectify,
      erase, restrict or object to the processing where possible. If you ask us, where possible and lawful to do so, we
      will also tell you with whom we shared your personal data so that you can contact them directly.</p>
    <p>If you have any concerns about how we handle your data, please contact us. If you are not satisfied after we’ve
      tried to resolve your issue, you’ll be entitled to lodge a complaint with the data protection regulator in your
      relevant jurisdiction. If you are based in the UK, this is the Information Commissioners’ Office. If you are based
      in the EU, you can find your relevant local supervisory authority here:

        target="_blank">https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en.</a>
    </p>
    <h2>Third party links</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy only addresses Feed’s use and disclosure of your personal data. The App and Website may
      contain links to other websites and apps, including those of our business partners, suppliers, social media pages
      hosted on third party platforms and affiliates. If you follow a link to any of these sites, please note that sites
      have their own privacy policies and we are not responsible for these policies or for their misuse of any personal
      data. </p>
    <p>Similarly, where your use of the App involves logging in via or connecting your user account to any third party
      social platforms, we will only be responsible for the processing of any personal data provided through those
      platforms insofar as they are used within the App. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any
      external links/platforms used in connection with the Feed Services before you submit any personal information
      through them.</p>
    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>The Feed Services are not intended for use by or targeted at children under 13, and we do not knowingly or
      intentionally collect information about children under 13. Children under 13 should not use the App.</p>
    <h2>Changes to this privacy policy</h2>
    <p>As Feed and the Feed Services change from time to time, we may need to update this Privacy Policy to reflect
      changes to our information practices, technology and legal requirements. We will post any changes to this Privacy
      Policy on the App and Website from time to time and, where appropriate, notify you by SMS/notification via the
      App. </p>
    <p>Please periodically review this Privacy Policy before using the Feed Services as continued use of the Feed
      Services shall indicate your acceptance of any changes. All personal information held by us will be governed by
      the most recent Privacy Policy posted on the App and/or Website from the date of the last update at the start of
      this Privacy Policy.</p>
