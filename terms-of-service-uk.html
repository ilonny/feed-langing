    <p>10.3. You may only transfer your rights or your obligations under these terms to another person if we agree in
      writing.</p>
    <p>10.4. This agreement does not give rise to any rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to
      enforce any term of this agreement.</p>
    <p>10.5. Each of the paragraphs of these terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that
      any of them are unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.</p>
    <p>10.6. Even if we delay in enforcing this contract, we can still enforce it later. If we do not insist immediately
      that you do anything you are required to do under these terms, or if we delay in taking steps against you in
      respect of your breaking this contract, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not
      prevent us taking steps against you at a later date.</p>
