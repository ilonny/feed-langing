  <p>
    We use cookies and 3rd party beacons on our website (currently <a href="https://feedapp.me">https://feedapp.me</a>) and in the App. We use these technologies in order to ensure and improve the quality of the App and website. We do not use these technologies for retargeting except for a short period of not more than one month. When you use the website or App, you consent to us using these technologies.

Google may collect information about your use of our website, combine this information with data from other websites that you have visited, and which also work with Google, and use this information for its own purposes (e.g. to control advertising).

  <p>
    We also use <b>Google Firebase</b> in our App in order to collect information about your use of the App, information about the device on which you install the App, including your country/location, the device make and model, its operating system, when the App was opened your language settings, the Identifier for Advertising (iOS) and the Google Advertising ID (for Android), in order to understand your behaviour better and optimize our App. We use such information in order to understand the use of our App and identify where the performance of the App can be improved to address performance issues. Firebase (Google) also remembers settings of the mobile app (like appearance, A/B test settings, custom content or updates), and evaluates and reacts to processes within the App. In A/B tests, individual functions are introduced on a test basis before the release of a new version of the App, and the effects of the adjustments during use can be analysed. Firebase is also used to track and fix app stability issues (technical errors and crashes) in real time. In the event of a crash, anonymous information about the device used and the use of the App is transmitted to Google’s servers in the USA to determine the cause. Crash reports do not contain personal data. You can object to data processing by Crashlytics at any time by deactivating the “Send crash reports” function in the App settings.For more information on Firebase please visit <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy?hl=en">Privacy and Security in Firebase</a>, or <a href="https://firebase.google.com/terms/data-processing-terms?hl=en">Firebase Data Processing and Security Terms</a>, or <a href="https://firebase.google.com/terms/crashlytics-app-distribution-data-processing-terms?hl=en.">Crashlytics and App Distribution Data Processing and Security Terms</a>.

    We also use <b>Amplitude</b> in our App and website, an analysis service of Amplitude Inc. (631 Howard Street, Suite 300, San Francisco, CA 94105, USA).
