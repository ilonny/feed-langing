            <ol>
                <li>Feed works on freemium model of subscription. It means that you can use your account for free with
                    some user limitations. By choosing the paid subscription you will be offered with more functionality
                    and additional features. Before you pay any fees, you will have an opportunity to review and accept
                    the fees that you will be charged. All fees are in U.S. Dollars and are non-refundable. Fees vary
                    based on the plan, with different pricing schemes for individual users and organizations.</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Price</strong></p>

            <ol>
                <li>Feed reserves the right to determine pricing for the Service. Feed will make reasonable efforts to
                    keep pricing information published on the website up to date. We encourage you to check our website
                    periodically for current pricing information, located here: [product]/prices/</li>
            </ol>

            <ol>
                <li>Feed may change the fees for any feature of the Service, including additional fees or charges, if
                    Feed gives you advance notice of changes before they apply. Feed at its sole discretion, may make
                    promotional offers with different features and different pricing to any of Feed&rsquo;s customers.
                    These promotional offers, unless made to you, will not apply to your offer or these Terms.</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Authorization</strong></p>

            <ol>
                <li>You authorize Feed to charge all sums for the orders that you make and any level of Service you
                    select as described in these Terms or published by Feed, to the payment method specified in your
                    account. If you pay any fees with a credit card, Feed may seek pre-authorization of your credit card
                    account prior to your purchase to verify that the credit card is valid and has the necessary funds
                    or credit available to cover your purchase.</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Subscription Service and Cancellation Policy</strong></p>

                <li>The Service may include automatically recurring payments for periodic charges (&ldquo;Subscription
                    Service&rdquo;). If you activate a Subscription Service, you authorize Feed to periodically charge,
                    on a going-forward basis and until cancellation of either the recurring payments or your account,
                    all accrued sums on or before the payment due date for the accrued sums. The &ldquo;Subscription
                    Billing Date&rdquo; is the date when you purchase your first subscription to the Service. For
                    information on the &ldquo;Subscription Fee&rdquo;, please see our Billing page. Your account will be
                    charged automatically on the Subscription Billing Date all applicable fees for the next subscription

                    it. You must cancel your subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next
                    periodic Subscription Fee to your account. We will bill the periodic Subscription Fee to the payment
                    method you provide to us during registration (or to a different payment method if you change your
                    payment information). You may cancel the Subscription Service by accessing your account profile
                    settings and clicking on the "Delete account" option or by contacting us at: <a
